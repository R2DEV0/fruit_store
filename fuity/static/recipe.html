<p>Instructions: 1.To make the avocado crema: First, soak the cashews for 20 minutes in water. Prepare remaining steps in this recipe while the cashews are soaking. Drain off water and add cashews, along with lime juice, garlic, paprika and avocado to a
    blender container. Add soy milk and process until smooth. May add additional soy milk if needed to make a smooth, creamy texture. If desired, season with a pinch of salt (optional). Transfer to bowl. 2. To make the jackfruit carnitas: While cashews
    are soaking, heat olive oil in a skillet and saute onion, jalapeno and garlic for 5 minutes. Add chili powder, cumin and oregano. Stir well. Add the drained jackfruit, breaking it apart into strands with a fork while it’s cooking (about 2 minutes).
    Add hot sauce (adjust for your preference of spiciness), tomato paste, lime juice and soy sauce. Continue to cook, breaking apart jackfruit with a fork, for an additional 4 minutes, until vegetables are soft, seasonings are well blended and jackfruit
    is separated into strands. Remove from heat. 3. To make the black beans and quinoa: While you’re cooking jackfruit carnitas, heat a small skillet and add olive oil. Add drained beans and cooked quinoa. Stir and heat for about 5 minutes, until heated
    through. May add a pinch of salt and pepper, if desired (optional). Remove from heat. 4. Prepare tortillas: Roast corn tortillas in a toaster oven or the top rack of the oven for about 3 minutes for open-face or folded crispy tacos, or heat them in
    a pan for 2 minutes for soft tacos. 5. To prepare tacos: Line tacos with a layer of cabbage, black beans and quinoa and jackfruit carnitas. Top with a dollop of avocado crema and garnish with cilantro. Nutrition information (per taco): 365 calories;
